   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set environment variables**

## Run Seeder (Optional)
 To populate your database with a sample user, projects, and tasks:
 1- Make sure your .env has a working DB_URI
 2- Run the following command:
 
               node seed.js

   This will:
    => Connect to MongoDB
    => Delete all existing users, projects, and tasks
    => Create:
       -> 1 verified user (test@example.com / Test@123)
       -> 2 projects
       -> 6 tasks (3 tasks per project)
